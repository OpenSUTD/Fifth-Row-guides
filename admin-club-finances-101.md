# Club Finances 101: Absolute Basics

## Introduction

---

This guide gives a brief overview of how the club treasurer can manage the income and claims from the student club fund, updating of the transaction register for the current financial year and some basic information on how to do the club budget plan.

Financial years (FY) are usually annotated with the year, and reset around **March** of each year (rolling over into the _current calendar year_), so March of 2019, for example, is when FY2019 begins.

Seed funds only get credited into the club funds around **May**.

If you have doubts or enquiries about club finances, you should contact your **cluster representatives** or the Office of Student Life directly.

## Income / Deposits

---

### Collecting Cash as income

Generally, for any cash collection, you will _need_ a receipt book. The process is outlined below:

1. Email OSL to book an appointment to collect a receipt book
   > Note: without a receipt book you are **not allowed to collect cash as income**. Receipt books are to be returned within 3 working days after the income has been collected.
2. Collect the money and issue receipts to the payer. The carbon copies of the receipt have to contain the same details as the copy given to the payer, and receipts _may only be signed_ by either the Treasurer, the Secretary, or the President (or equivalent).
3. Email OSL to book a date to deposit your income, together with the following items:
   - **Income Deposit Form**, fully filled out
   - **Receipt Book**
   - Your **cash** to be deposited as income

### Income deposits from sponsorship/donation

Seek approval from OSL **_in writing_** before you approach a company for sponsorship. Generally, this process also has a few additional requirements, which you must submit **well before (3 months)** the start of the event:

1. Event Proposal (EPF)
2. List of Companies
3. Supporting Proposal
4. Cover Letter

Once you contact the company and get officially sponsored, _pass the cheque_ you receive to OSL along with your filled-out Income Deposit Form.

PLEASE NOTE: You DO NOT need to fill in the following sections:

- Deposit code
- Additional attachments portion
- Acknowledged by portion

## Student Claims and Purchase Requests

---

### Purchases below \$300: Purchase Request Form

For purchases below \$300, the primary form concerned is the Purchase Request Form (PRF).

> Note that for all purchases, approval must be sought before claims - which means that the date used for signing **must be before** the date of purchase.

In the case of a purchase (or set of purchases) that come to less than \$300, the following process applies when you wish to claim your purchase.

1. The _Purchaser_ (that is, who paid for it) **must** submit the PRF to their club Treasurer for approval, with the following fields filled out:
   1. Student Organization
   2. Name of Project / Purchase
   3. Purchase Information (Note that this doesn't necessarily need to be complete, but just descriptive enough)
   4. Prepared By (Place Purchaser's Name here, along with the date)
      > Note: In the event that the Treasurer is the Purchaser, the President must be the approving authority.
2. _Treasurer/President_ approves the purchase, filling in the following fields in the PRF:
   1. Project Code
   2. Approved By
   3. Fund to be Claimed From
      > Note: This is either the OSL Seed Fund, or your own club Income account.
   4. Balance in the Fund at time of signature
      > As OSL-given Seed Funds do not carry forward year-over-year, it is recommended that you spend your Seed Funds before you use your Income Fund accounts.
3. Purchase your approved item. Remember to get your [proof of purchase](#notes-on-proof-of-purchase)!
4. Fill out the Student Claim Form (SCF). [Refer to the TL;DR here for a handy checklist](#tldr-student-claim-form).

A convenient checklist is available in the following section.

### TLDR: Purchase Request Form

The Purchase Request Form is handily summarized in a checklist here:

| Field                      | Person              | Dependency                         | Sample Entry | Notes                                    |

### Notes on Proof-of-Purchase

There are differing requirements for Proof-of-Purchase for different sources:

#### Local Shop/Supplier

For purchases from a local shop, you **must** ask for a receipt/invoice with _at least_ the following key features:

- A Company Stamp/ Logo / Letterhead
- Information about your purchase (an item description at least)
- Date of Purchase
- A receipt number

Purchase descriptions need to actually describe the item that you get, and have to contain the full price of the item that is being sold, along with some indication as to where the item came from - a handwritten receipt with no logo or letterhead or distinguishing marks and no receipt number **will not be accepted.**

The invoice/receipt is to be affixed to the paper by either:

1. Taping down the corners of your receipt to a sheet of A4 blank paper
2. Gluing it to the sheet of A4 blank paper (Recommended)

#### Online Supplier (Taobao, AliExpress)

For suppliers like Taobao or AliExpress, who do not have traditional invoices or receipts for easy claims, you need to obtain the screenshot of each individual purchase under `MyTaobao` in the menu bar - excluding any delivery fees.

> Delivery fees are paid separately from the original purchase, so you need to prepare another PRF just for the delivery fees.

If you make payment in a foreign currency, you will need a statement of the currency conversion rate converted at the date of purchase from [Oanda Converter](https://www.oanda.com/currency/converter/).

In addition, you need to provide either a Credit Card Statement or Bank Statement indicating clearly the deduction from your account that shows the following:

- Bank Account Number
- Name of Account Holder
- Transaction Amount matching your claim amount
- Date of Purchase
- Purchase Description

Each invoice should have its own page. Supporting documents may go on the same page as well. Make sure all documents are printed _large enough to be read_.

#### Online Supplier (Non-Taobao, Non-AliExpress)

Wherever possible, obtain an official receipt or purchase document that can evidence that you were the purchaser, typically containing the following details:

1. Purchaser
2. Value of Purchase (in an item breakdown)
3. Date of Purchase
4. Invoice Reference Number

Where not possible, find some other proof of purchase, like the order listing from Amazon, or the e-mail confirmation of payment. Remember to ensure that the text is large enough to be _read easily._

> Note: There is often a print button for a purchase confirmation page, so you can easily print to PDF and save the file on your computer for printing later.

### TLDR: Student Claim Form

The student claim form, once you've been issued with it, has a list of details to check off before you hand it in for a claim:

- Name: Is this the person getting the money back?
- ID: Does this match the student ID of the Name?
- Organisation: Is this your club's name?
- Purpose: Does this tally with your PRF?
- Purchase Information:
  1. Did you remember to itemize individual purchase bundles?
  2. Did you remember to take out GST for GST items?
  3. Did you remember to put in the receipt numbers?
- Declaration: Are you sure all the fields are correct? Sign off.
- Verification: Did the person in charge sign off?

> Note: OSL opens accounts for claims, so if the same person buys different items on different dates, the items can be placed in the same claim form, but **different** PRFs/PAFs are needed depending on what the purpose of the purchase is.

<h3>Managing the transaction register </h3>

---

Start from the beginning of Seed Fund opening balance - sort of new financial year (should be around May period)

Labels for claims - SCF-{YY}-{CLUBNUMBER}-{XXXX}

Labels for income - INC {YY}-{CLUBNUMBER}-{XXXX}

- where Y refers to the Year and XXXX refers to the number of claim form. i.e. Claim form number 30 will have XXXX as 0030.

For claims:

- OSL absorbs the GST for the club funds, so the income/seed club fund is deducted with GST excluded. i.e. If claim is $107, OSL absorbs GST - $7, \$100 is deducted from whatever fund claimant is claiming from.

For income:

- OSL takes GST for income into club funds, so income/seed club fund income after GST is deducted will be deposited into the club income fund. i.e. if income is $107, OSL takes GST - $7, \$100 is deposited into club income fund.

<h3>Handling the Pulse Check Budget Plan</h3>

---

Budget plan is basically an overview of the plan for the following year - events, workshops, purchases to be made etc. This will be used to pitch to OSL to request for how much seed funds is required for the following year.

<h3>Stakeholders</h3>

Contact OSL via booking an appointment/email for any enquiries.
