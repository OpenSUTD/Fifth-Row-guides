## Introduction

---

This guide gives a brief overview of how the club treasurer can manage the income and claims from the student club fund, updating of the transaction register for the current financial year and some basic information on how to do the club budget plan.

Financial years (FY) are usually annotated with the year, and reset around **March** of each year (rolling over into the _current calendar year_), so March of 2019, for example, is when FY2019 begins.

Seed funds only get credited into the club funds around **May**.

If you have doubts or enquiries about club finances, you should contact your **cluster representatives** or the Office of Student Life directly.

## Income / Deposits

---

### Collecting Cash as Income

Generally, for any cash collection, you will _need_ a receipt book. The process is outlined below:

1. Email OSL to book an appointment to collect a receipt book
   > Note: without a receipt book you are **not allowed to collect cash as income**. Receipt books are to be returned within 3 working days after the income has been collected.
2. Collect the money and issue receipts to the payer. The carbon copies of the receipt have to contain the same details as the copy given to the payer, and receipts _may only be signed_ by either the Treasurer, the Secretary, or the President (or equivalent).
3. Email OSL to book a date to deposit your income, together with the following items:
   - **Income Deposit Form**, fully filled out
   - **Receipt Book**
   - Your **cash** to be deposited as income

### Income Deposits from Sponsorship/Donation

Seek approval from OSL **_in writing_** before you approach a company for sponsorship. Generally, this process also has a few additional requirements, which you must submit **well before (3 months)** the start of the event:

1. Event Proposal (EPF)
2. List of Companies
3. Supporting Proposal
4. Cover Letter

Once you contact the company and get officially sponsored, _pass the cheque_ you receive to OSL along with your filled-out Income Deposit Form.

> **PLEASE NOTE**: You _do not_ need to fill in the following sections:

- Deposit code
- Additional attachments portion
- Acknowledged by portion

## Student Claims and Purchase Requests

---

### Purchases below \$300: Purchase Request Form

For purchases below \$300, the primary form concerned is the Purchase Request Form (PRF).

> Note that for all purchases, approval must be sought before claims - which means that the date used for signing **must be before** the date of purchase.

In the case of a purchase (or set of purchases) that come to less than \$300, the following process applies when you wish to claim your purchase.

1. The _Purchaser_ (that is, who paid for it) **must** submit the PRF to their club Treasurer for approval, with the following fields filled out:
   1. Student Organization
   2. Name of Project / Purchase
   3. Purchase Information (Note that this doesn't necessarily need to be complete, but just descriptive enough)
   4. Prepared By (Place Purchaser's Name here, along with the date)
      > Note: In the event that the Treasurer is the Purchaser, the President must be the approving authority.
2. _Treasurer/President_ approves the purchase, filling in the following fields in the PRF:
   1. Project Code
   2. Approved By
   3. Fund to be Claimed From
      > Note: This is either the OSL Seed Fund, or your own club Income account.
   4. Balance in the Fund at time of signature
      > As OSL-given Seed Funds do not carry forward year-over-year, it is recommended that you spend your Seed Funds before you use your Income Fund accounts.
3. Purchase your approved item. Remember to get your [proof of purchase](#notes-on-proof-of-purchase)!
4. Fill out the Student Claim Form (SCF). [Refer to the TL;DR here for a handy checklist](#tldr-student-claim-form).

A convenient checklist is available in the following section.

### TLDR: Purchase Request Form

The Purchase Request Form is handily summarized in a checklist here:

| Field                      | Person              | Dependency                         | Sample Entry | Notes                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Project Code               | Treasurer           | -                                  | SLCLUB0XX    | This should be your club's account code. |
| Student Organisation       | Purchaser           | -                                  | SOAR         | Your club / organising committee name    |
| Name of Project / Purchase | Purchaser           | -                                  | ROBOCLASH    | Event you're purchasing for              |
| Purchase Information       | Purchaser           | -                                  | Robot Parts  | What kind of items you're buying         |
| Estimated Cost             | Purchaser           | -                                  | \$500        | Estimated price of your items            |
| Prepared By                | Purchaser           | -                                  | Lim Ah Kow   | Claimant's name                          |
| Date                       | Purchaser           | BEFORE RECEIPT DATE                | 13/5/2019    | The date you made this                   |
| Approved By                | Treasurer/President | President if claimant is Treasurer | Tan Ah Lian  | Approver                                 |
| Approval Date              | Treasurer/President | BEFORE RECEIPT DATE                | 14/5/2019    | The date it was approved                 |
| Fund Claiming              | Treasurer/President | Income/Seed Fund                   | Income       | What fund you're drawing to pay for this |
| Balance in above fund      | Treasurer/President | -                                  | \$500        | How much is in the fund                  |

### Notes on Proof-of-Purchase

There are differing requirements for Proof-of-Purchase for different sources:

#### Local Shop/Supplier

For purchases from a local shop, you **must** ask for a receipt/invoice with _at least_ the following key features:

- A Company Stamp/ Logo / Letterhead
- Information about your purchase (an item description at least)
- Date of Purchase
- A receipt number

Purchase descriptions need to actually describe the item that you get, and have to contain the full price of the item that is being sold, along with some indication as to where the item came from - a handwritten receipt with no logo or letterhead or distinguishing marks and no receipt number **will not be accepted.**

The invoice/receipt is to be affixed to the paper by either:

1. Taping down the corners of your receipt to a sheet of A4 blank paper
2. Gluing it to the sheet of A4 blank paper (Recommended)

#### Online Supplier (Taobao, AliExpress)

For suppliers like Taobao or AliExpress, who do not have traditional invoices or receipts for easy claims, you need to obtain the screenshot of each individual purchase under `MyTaobao` in the menu bar - excluding any delivery fees.

> Delivery fees are paid separately from the original purchase, so you need to prepare another PRF just for the delivery fees.

If you make payment in a foreign currency, you will need a statement of the currency conversion rate converted at the date of purchase from [Oanda Converter](https://www.oanda.com/currency/converter/).

In addition, you need to provide either a Credit Card Statement or Bank Statement indicating clearly the deduction from your account that shows the following:

- Bank Account Number
- Name of Account Holder
- Transaction Amount matching your claim amount
- Date of Purchase
- Purchase Description

Each invoice should have its own page. Supporting documents may go on the same page as well. Make sure all documents are printed _large enough to be read_.

#### Online Supplier (Non-Taobao, Non-AliExpress)

Wherever possible, obtain an official receipt or purchase document that can evidence that you were the purchaser, typically containing the following details:

1. Purchaser
2. Value of Purchase (in an item breakdown)
3. Date of Purchase
4. Invoice Reference Number

> Go to the shopping cart and go to the purchase page UNTIL right before you reach the page where you need to key in your credit/debit card information. This page should have these:
>
> 1. The logo/name of the shopping platform clearly shown
> 2. Shipping fees
> 3. Item Purchase cost

Where not possible, find some other proof of purchase, like the order listing from Amazon, or the e-mail confirmation of payment. Remember to ensure that the text is large enough to be _read easily._

> Note: There is often a print button for a purchase confirmation page, so you can easily print to PDF and save the file on your computer for printing later.

### TLDR: Student Claim Form

The student claim form, once you've been issued with it, has a list of details to check off before you hand it in for a claim:

- **Name**: Is this the person getting the money back?
- **ID**: Does this match the student ID of the Name?
- **Organisation**: Is this your club's name?
- **Purpose**: Does this tally with your PRF?
- **Purchase** Information:
  1. Did you remember to itemize individual purchase bundles?
  2. Did you remember to take out **GST** for GST items?
  3. Did you remember to put in the **receipt numbers**?
- **Declaration**: Are you sure all the fields are correct? Sign off.
- **Verification**: Did the person in charge sign off?

> Note: OSL opens accounts for claims, so if the same person buys different items on different dates, the items can be placed in the same claim form, but **different** PRFs/PAFs are needed depending on what the purpose of the purchase is.

### Purchases between $300 and $1000: Purchase Award Form

For all purchases above the value of \$300, the Purchase Award Form (PAF) is the key concern.

> As with the PRF, if the Treasurer is purchasing, the President has to approve.

In this case, a similar process applies as in the [sub-\$300 category:](#purchases-below-300-purchase-request-form)

1. The Purchaser wants to buy, say, item _X_.
2. Get **at least 3 quotations** from different suppliers for item _X_ that are **substitutable**. For a quick-start guide on how to format the quotations, [click here.](#quotations-how-to)
   > Note: "substitutable" means that the quotation is for the same amount of goods for the same use - it need not be exact same item, per se, but it must cover the exact same use-cases. It should ideally be _apples-to-apples_.
3. Fill out the Purchase Award Form with the following details:
   1. Student Organisation
   2. Name of Project/Purchase
   3. Purchase Information (Item, quantity, reason for purchase, quoted cost)
   4. Prepared By (Purchaser)
4. Attach your quotations by printing out either the email in which you are quoted or the screenshot of your shopping cart on an e-commerce site.
5. Submit your PAF to your treasurer. They need to fill out the following fields and approve your PAF:
   1. Project Code
   2. Approved-by (Note that the same caveat for Treasurer-Purchasers in the PRF applies)
   3. Fund to be claimed from
   4. Balance in the above fund at time of signature
   5. Evaluation Conducted by:
      > Note that this field can either be done by the treasurer OR the purchaser
   6. Name of recommended vendor and reason for choice

### TLDR: Purchase Award Form

The use of the Purchase Award Form is handily summarized here:

| Field                                      | Person              | Dependency                     | Sample Entry | Notes                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project Code                               | Treasurer           | -                              | SLCLUB001    | Your club's account code                                             |
| Student Organisation                       | Purchaser           | -                              | SUTD Club    | Your club's name                                                     |
| Name of Project/Purchase                   | Purchaser           | -                              | Project X    | The name of the event/reason you're purchasing                       |
| Purchase Information                       | Purchaser           | Quotations                     | -            | Put in the name of your item, and the quotation prices you received. |
| Approved By                                | Treasurer/President | Fund must have enough          | -            | The approving personnel                                              |
| Fund to be claimed from                    | Treasurer           | Fund must have enough          | -            | This is the club account that is being claimed from                  |
| Balance in above fund at time of signature | Treasurer           | Fund must have enough          | -            | This should cover your costs.                                        |
| 3 Quotations                               | Purchaser           | Must be from different sources | -            | [Your quotations](#quotations-how-to)                                |

#### Quotations: How-to

No matter what kind of quotation you have, submitting them requires you to either save them as a PDF or print them out fully to submit with your PAF. They must also have:

1. The logo/name of your shopping platform/supplier (so if you're getting from Taobao you need the taobao logo at the top of the page)
2. The sum total of the shipping fees/handling fees
3. The cost of each individual item

> Note: If you are getting your quotation through an e-commerce shop, you proceed with the purchase shopping cart **up until the point** where you are about to pay with your credit-card information, etc.
> Then you save the page.

Waivers of quotations **should never happen** unless there is only a single distributor of this item in Singapore / or under a sole patent. If you Google whatever you are purchasing and there are other vendors selling the product that are accessible locally, your item does not fall in this category.

For foreign currency purchases, you will need a screenshot of the currency conversion from [Oanda](https://www.oanda.com/currency/converter/) for **each** vendor that you purchase items from.

> Note: Different users selling on Taobao count as _separate sellers_.

### Purchases above \$1000: Approval

For purchases that exceed \$1000 dollars in price, you will need to get **written approval** from the Office of Student Life before you make your purchase. Otherwise, you fill in both the [Purchase Award Form](#TLDR-Purchase-Award-Form) and the [Claim Form](#TLDR-Student-Claim-Form) accordingly.

## Maintaining A Transaction Register

The transaction register is basically your club's entire financial records. It's important because it tells you (and the people after you) where all the money you spent went! This is also vital to ensure that both you and the school know that all the money you spent is going the right way.

You, current President/Exco/Treasurer, might know right now, but you can't guarantee that all of your juniors will know! Hence: **Record-keeping**.

### Labelling Entries In the Register

The entry format for the transaction register differs based on which type of entry it is, but you reset the serial number count at the start of each new Financial Year, which is in May.

May 2019 marks the start of Financial Year 2019, not 2020!

#### Claims / Income - Transaction Register

> `[SCF/INC]-{YY}-{CLUBNUMBER}-{XXXX}`

Where the format can be broken down thus:

1. `SCF`: Student Claim Form OR `INC` Income Deposit
2. `{YY}`: The current Financial Year
3. `{CLUBNUMBER}`: Your Club's Financial Account Code
4. `{XXXX}`: The Total number of financial documents you've filed of this type this financial year (i.e. the rolling number)

So let's say I'm filing a Student Claim entry for a ficticious club with `{CLUBNUMBER}` 000 in the current Financial Year (FY19 at time of writing). Then, if this is the **3rd** form I'm doing this year for claims, the code will be:

`SCF-19-000-0003`

Whereas if I am depositing income from my **first** event of the year for a ficticious club with `{CLUBNUMBER}` 000 in the current Financial Year (FY19 at time of writing), my code would be:

`INC-19-000-0001`

### Recording Claims and Income Values

#### Claims & GST

OSL is supposed to absorb the GST cost of any purchase you make that is GST-eligible, due to SUTD becoming a GST-registered entity in 2017. As a result, your income/seed funds should be deducted the **GST-FREE** cost - i.e. if your claim is $107, $100 is deducted from whatever fund you claim from instead.

> **Caveat:** Note that this does not apply to the legacy income accounts (income earned before 2017). Spend carefully.

If your claim is for an item that is not bought from a GST-registered entity, you should deduct the _full cost_ of the item from your funds.

#### Income Collection & Entries

OSL takes out the cost of GST from your income, so all of your income has GST deducted from it before it is put into your account. That means that if you earn $107, your account will be credited $100 - the \$7 goes to the IRAS.

## Queries and Q&A

If you have a query, please feel free to raise an issue! Otherwise, contact OSL with your query and submit a pull-request with what they've taught you (or open an issue)

## Budgeting & Finance for Pulse Check

This will be covered in a separate document. Please check back soon.
