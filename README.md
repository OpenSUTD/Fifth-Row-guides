# Introduction

Welcome! If you're here, you're likely a Fifth-Row leader or Student Club hopeful. 

The guides here are meant to help you with navigating the organizational processes of SUTD, and hopefully to ensure that we can get **better** at processes and smooth things over more.

# How to Use This Repository

This repo is meant as a storehouse of knowledge, so if you see anything you'd like to add on as a fifth-row leader or just anything at all about navigating organizational processes, feel free to submit a pull request!

Just remember to label your markdown files, etc appropriately.

## Contributing to this Repository (As an OpenSUTD member)

For reference, all files should be named according to their purpose. This is to ensure that indexing (by the machine) causes all similar topics to end up in the same chunk:

`topic-subject-details`

Hence for a file, say, for claims under $300 dollars from an income account, you'll want to name it as such:

`claims-under-300-dollars-from-club-income`.

If a topic exists that's close enough, **don't** create a new file. Make changes and **submit a pull request instead.**

## Contributing as an external party (Non-OpenSUTD maintainer team)

Navigate to the [**`for-review`**](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/fifth-row-guides/tree/for-review) branch of this repository and submit your files/edit files and submit a pull request!
