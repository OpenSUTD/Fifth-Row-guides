# Surviving Pulse Check

## Uh, What is Pulse Check?

Pulse Check is exactly what is says on the tin: A check to make sure that your student club is still alive and kicking. This involves the following:

- **Reviewing all your activities** for the past year
- Checking on your **financial status**, and if your books tally
- **Updates** on future plans and current initiatives
- **Any questions** the Office of Student Life may have regarding your club and its health

It's typically held in the **first few weeks of January of each year**, during the Independent Activities Period (commonly called *IAP*).

## Okay, But Why Does This Matter to Me?

***If you're a Fifth Row Leader and you're asking this question, man, do I have some bad news for you...***

### Why Pulse Check Matters (For Fifth-Row Leaders)

This is your Year-In-Review. This is *THE* premier event that matters for your club. This is the one thing ***you should absolutely NEVER screw up***.

Pulse Check is the one event in a year that is ***mandatory*** for all Official Fifth-Rows. It is where you get to do two very important things (At least, if you still want to have a club in the coming year):

1. It is where you pitch to the school for **your budget in seed funding** for the coming year. *No Pulse Check, no money.*
2. It is where you make the case to the school for *keeping your club as an official club* and not downgrading it to a **Probationary School Club** or an **Interest Group**.

**That means the three lifelines of a club all hinge on Pulse Check:**

- Your *Official Club Email* (you know, that thing you use to communicate with sponsors...?)
- Your *Club Budget*
- Your *ability to request resources from the school* (as a club)

Very clearly, it matters a lot.

### Why Pulse Check Matters (For Interest Groups, Probationary Clubs)

It's really the same reason as above, because to earn a club status, you need to prove that you can do everything a club can, including ***all of the administrative work***.

Plus, it really gives you an insight into what being a full-time Student Club is going to be like.



## How Do I Pulse Check?

### 1. Prepared Forms

The process of Pulse Check, as with most administrative work, starts with **the forms** that the Office of Student Life will ***email*** out to every club.

Usually, the email comes around in November-early Dec, so keep an eye out for it and **make sure you fill it out and submit it by the deadline.**

This deadline is ***usually end-December.***

Don't be afraid to fill out the form wrongly; It matters more that the form is **submitted mostly correct and on time** than *perfectly but too late*.

### 2. Ask Your Cluster Rep What Else To Prep

Fortunately, SUTD's student club structure contains vital roles like Cluster Reps that can help you get through the Pulse Check. They'll be there at the meeting too, so **ask, ask, ask if you have doubts.**

Each respective cluster has their own Rep who *will be present at your meeting*, and who are usually aware of the specific agendas that your Office of Student Life advisor will want to be pushing and ask for.

They may also help you with:

- Ensuring that all of your paperwork is in order (***CC them in your form submission email***)
- Knowing what additional material you need for your Pulse Check (**a slide deck, a pitch, etc.**)
- Rationalizing any moves you've made in the year. There's always one or two people who will drop bombshells on the meeting with unannounced things that they should have long since contacted the Office with. **Don't be that guy.**

### 3. Know The Vital Details

This should really be obvious, but as the club Executive Committee, you need to be aware of the following facts, which are used to continue justifying your existence:

1. **Where did you spend all your money on this year? What percentage of it goes where?**
   - This is vital if you're pitching for more money: If you can't explain where all that money goes, why should *anyone* want to give you more?
   - Additionally this is also a sign of your club being active with its own projects
2. **How many people are there in your club? Do you have requisite numbers?**
   - This is important, because one of the stipulations for a club to remain a club is that you must have *at least 10 active members*.
3. **What things have you done this year?**
   - Once again, this is for the sake of justifying the school spending resources on you.
   - You too should be aware of what your club's doing. A club leader with no idea over the state of their own club is *no leader at all*.

### 4. Have A Vision

This is slightly less important if you're just looking to upkeep existing projects, but you should still have a good idea where and what your club is growing towards.

*You should know what your club is planned to look like at the end of your next year.*

This is vital as well for the continued existence for your club: **You must align the interests of your members towards your vision.** If you can't sustain long-term projects, your club is also doomed to die after your fiery self stops pushing.
