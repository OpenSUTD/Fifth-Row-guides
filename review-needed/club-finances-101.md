<h3>Managing the transaction register </h3>

---

Start from the beginning of Seed Fund opening balance - sort of new financial year (should be around May period)

Labels for claims - SCF-{YY}-{CLUBNUMBER}-{XXXX} 

Labels for income - INC {YY}-{CLUBNUMBER}-{XXXX}

- where Y refers to the Year and XXXX refers to the number of claim form. i.e. Claim form number 30 will have XXXX as 0030.

For claims: 

- OSL absorbs the GST for the club funds, so the income/seed club fund is deducted with GST excluded. i.e. If claim is $107, OSL absorbs GST - $7, $100 is deducted from whatever fund claimant is claiming from. 

For income: 

- OSL takes GST for income into club funds, so income/seed club fund income after GST is deducted will be deposited into the club income fund. i.e. if income is $107, OSL takes GST - $7, $100 is deposited into club income fund. 

<h3>Handling the Pulse Check Budget Plan</h3>

---

Budget plan is basically an overview of the plan for the following year - events, workshops, purchases to be made etc. This will be used to pitch to OSL to request for how much seed funds is required for the following year.
