## Introduction

An Event Processing Form (EPF for short) is a form submission that is mandatory for submission for approval before a proposed activity can be carried out. 

As a club, EPFs are required to be submitted and approved before the club can conduct and receive *official* recognition of their **internally** conducted activities. These forms are approved by OSL and Student Government - Events.

## Steps/Process

The following flow chart illustrates the process and flow of forms required when it comes to organizing any event, be in an *internal*, *external* or specific events like *competitions*.

- The EPF form needs to submitted at least **1 month** before the event. This allows time for amendments or further clarifications prior to the approval of the event.
- Forms can be accessed through this [link](https://root.sutd.edu.sg/forms/).

Next, after the preparation of the EPF, most or if not all events, require the paired submission of **Risk Assessment Forms (RAFs)**. The next how-to guide will cover more details regarding this said form.

After action reviews (AARs) will be requested by OSL (along with a specified date of submission - usually within 2 weeks after the end of the event). AARs will be submitted through email and serves to update OSL and SG-Events on the outcome and notable points during the process of conducting the event. The following *should* be included:

- Brief details or response and feedback
- Number of attendees
  - Include entry fees charged (**if applicable**)
- Notable points
- Pictures (**At least 6** - try to cover different perspectives) or Videos

## Stakeholders

-  You, the club representatives
   -  Propose and come up with the action plan
   -  Make sure the event is carried out according to plan
-  OSL
   -  Provide advise on the carrying out of events
   -  Act as secondary approving body for event
-  Student Government Events (SG-Events)
   -  Primary approving body for event

For small events that are clear-cut and straightforward (For example *Workshops*), the EPFs can be submitted and approved through email without the need of a **physical meetup**.

However, for larger scale events, meetups with the respective stakeholders will likely happen, as on-site clarification is the faster form of resolution of issues.
