## Introduction

A Risk Assessment Form (RAF for short) is a form submission that is mandatory for submission for approval before a proposed activity can be carried out. 

This form is an excel form to fill up that can be downloaded [here](https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/root-site/forms/events/Annex+A+Risk+Assessment+Form.xlsx). The form is an easy to fill up excel document with pre-defined different types of risks/hazards, along with its severity and likelihood of occurrence. 

Even simple workshop events with no risks whatsoever requires the submission of a RAF. Just fill the RAF with the mildest risk - or whichever you see fit. 

## Steps/Process

RAFs need to be completed regardless of activity.

- EPFs $\rightarrow$ RAFs
- Room booking $\rightarrow $ RAFs

The breakdown of the RAF is as follows:

- Identification of main risks
- Identification of severity of risks
- Identification of likelihood of risks

The RAF has an inbuilt cell format to calculate the "safety level", which is a score to how "safe" the corresponding activity identified is (with its identified risks, severity and likelihood). **Keep the score in the green to the best of your ability**. However, if the identified activity is of risk type yellow, provide a mitigative call of action/plan to reduce the likelihood or severity of the risk $\rightarrow​$ thereby decreasing the recalculated safety level score.

## Stakeholders

- You, the club representatives
  - Identify the main risks
  - Plan for mitigative actions to reduce likelihood / severity of risks
- OSL
  - Act as a medium to submit form to EHS (Environment Health Safety)
- EHS
  - Approving body for RAF
  - Not approve = No event
