## Introduction

Rooms are usually hard to find in SUTD, especially if your club requires storage space or require just a temporary loan of space to store event materials, or even the simple booking of club meeting venues.

## Steps/Process

### Booking of Club meeting venues

Send an email to your respective OSL body to request for a room booking. The email should include the date-time details, choice of venue as well as the expected number of passengers.<img src="../Resources/Book_Club_Venue_Msg.png"> </img>

Look out for the email for booking IDs of the room venue. 

### Booking of temporary loan spaces

- Send an email to your respective OSL body to request for a temporary space booking form and risk assessment form. 

- The form has a few sections to fill up, namely:
  - Project Details (Justification for requirement of temporary space)
  - Contact details
  - Space loan time period
  - Additional equipment required

- Space loan form must be submitted along with a completed risk assessment form (RAF). More details in `How To Write A Risk Assessment Form.md`
- Resend the completed forms back to OSL body
- Head down to Onestop center to sign on the printed hardcopy when OSL is finished processing the request, before they can submit the form to EHS



## Stakeholders

- You, the club representatives
  - Require the need for meeting venues
  - Require the need for storage space
    - Identify the main risks
    - Plan for mitigative actions to reduce likelihood / severity of risks
- OSL
  - Act as a medium to submit temporary space loan form to EHS (Environment Health Safety)
- EHS
  - Approving body for RAF
  - Not approved = No event (Although depending on need OSL might help you push)
