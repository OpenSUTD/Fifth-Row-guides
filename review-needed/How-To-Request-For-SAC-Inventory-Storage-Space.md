## Objective

This is a guide for club committee members who need a safe storage space for their valuable club items. The space discussed in this guide is the **Student Activity Centre (SAC)**, located at Building 5 level 4.

As mentioned, this *Storage Space* is not meant to be a **DUMP** of club items, but a **safekeep** of **valuable** club items. Do note that for any item in the inventory list, the `maker rep` has the right to reject the storage of the item if he deems so. More details in the [FAQ](#faqs).

## Process

1. Request for an inventory form from maker representative (`makers@rep.sutd.edu.sg`)

   The inventory form is discussed in detail below [here](#Form-Details).

2. Fill the form up with the relevant details. For items with no exact detail (For instance date, price), provide an estimation (basically an educated guess).
   Please refer to the form details section for any form queries [here](#Form-Details).

3. Submit the form back via the maker representative email. The email should also include the following details which are discussed [here](#Email-Details).

## FAQs

1. **My item is rejected! Why?** <br/>
   The acceptance or rejection of the storage of the item is decided by the `maker rep` and this could be attributed to the following reasons:
   - Item is hazardous (LiPo batteries - bloated with no proper LiPo carrier bags, highly flammable items, etc.). The storage space houses the valuable items of many other clubs and the safety of the items from other clubs must be respected as well.
   - Item is a personal item and **NOT** a club collective usage product. 
     If it is not clear enough, the storage space is for the use of **STORING** club items, and should not be abused to store individual / personal item(s). 
     **UNLESS** the said item(s) is usable by students who visit the SAC (Eg. 3D printer).
2. **My inventory list is not being entertained! Why?** <br/>
   This could be due to multiple reasons as discussed below:
   - `Maker rep` is a very busy person and he may have overlooked the email. Please understand that he is still a `human being` and some leeway and understanding should be given. 
     Dropping him or her a reminder email, or if you know him or her personally, a text or a face to face friendly reminder would suffice!
   - SAC storage space has been depleted. Do understand that the storage space is limited and on a first-come-first-served basis. However, if a reply is required, do not hesitate to reply the email and request for a status update of the SAC space request.
