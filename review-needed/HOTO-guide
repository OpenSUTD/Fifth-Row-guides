# How to conduct Hand Over, Take Over (HOTO) 

This is a guide on how to select a new Executive Committee (EXCO) team as well as conduct the HOTO process required to onboard the new team. 

## Introduction

The HOTO process is an internal club proceeding where the existing EXCO team steps down and a new EXCO team is brought onboard. However, forms have to be signed and submitted to OSL to allow them to acknowledge the change officially. HOTO can occur at any time and can also take place for individual EXCO members instead of the entire EXCO - as long as OSL is made aware of the change and provided the relevant documents.

That being said, HOTO is an important process in the cycle of 5th rows and thus should be handled carefully to reduce disruptions to club proceedings during the transition. Additionally, HOTO and training of the new EXCO should be completed **at least 2 weeks** before any pulse check.

The whole HOTO process should take around **8 weeks**. 

- Preparation: **2 weeks**
- Recruitment: **1 week**
- Training Phase: **4 weeks**
- HOTO Phase: **1 week**

## EXCO Positions

The EXCO team will minimally consist of the following (also known as the "big three"):

- **President:** Dictates overall club direction, face of the club with regards to official matters and meetings with OSL and Faculty.
- **Secretary:** Handles administrative tasks such as booking of venues, completion of forms and preparation of documents for pulse check.
- **Treasurer:** Deals with finances and claims, custodian for the club's various funds.

Other auxiliary positions may be filled as required by the club:

- **Vice-President:** Second-in-command to the president, often he/she will lead the other Exco members outside the big three.
- **Media In-charge:** Handles club's media (posters, photos, videos and manages the Instagram page).
- **Networking In-charge:** Handles the club's professional networking front (Linkedin and Facebook as well as participate in industry networking events)
- **Logistics In-charge / Quartermaster:** Handles the club's inventory and assists with procurement.

On top of these positions, it is also possible to request for additional roles if justified to OSL properly:

- **Club Advisor:** Seniors, Alumni who are actively involved in EXCO proceedings

The process on how to request for additional roles will be elaborated upon further down this guide.

**Warning: It is important that all club emails be sent / dealt with by EXCO members exclusively. OSL will request for an explanation if a non-EXCO member is seen signing off club emails. Any members who have to use the club email often should seek justification to be promoted to an EXCO position or barred from accessing the club email entirely.**



## Step-by-step Process

The following steps should be completed **at least 2 weeks** before a pulse check - it would be best if it is completed way ahead of any pulse check.

### Pre-recruitment preparation

1. **Two weeks** before recruitment of a new EXCO team, the Standard Operating Procedures and guides for each EXCO role should be completed by each existing EXCO member. Any preparation for On Job Training (OJT) programs should be completed.
2. A list of desired qualities for candidates of each EXCO position should be prepared so as to assist in the screening process.
3. A google application form (or hardcopy form) should be prepared to allow for EXCO applications. (This could include essay writing, self-description and the like)
4. If possible, a set of slides should be prepared:
   - Brief description of EXCO structure
   - EXCO day-to-day operation and expectations
   - Desired traits for applicants

### Recruitment Process

5. Announce that an EXCO recruitment presentation will be held (through email or the club telegram group) - this is to ensure the maximum pool of possible candidates.

6. Present the prepared slides and release the link to the application form.

7. Interview the applicants as soon as possible (this is especially important if recruiting Freshmores)

8. The existing EXCO team will then select the prospective president

9. Create a new Telegram group for the president and the existing EXCO - this would be the OJT group for the new EXCO

10. The prospective president will then select the other members of his team in conjunction with the existing EXCO

    > This is to ensure that the incoming EXCO team is cohesive and can work effectively with the president

### OJT Phase

11. Once the prospective EXCO team is formed, the existing EXCO can shift into the OJT phase and begin training the new EXCO on their tasks. The OJT phase **should be 1 month at least** and ideally constitute of various important tasks that the EXCO will be expected to conduct. 
12. **Inform OSL (Crystal) that the EXCO is currently training a new batch of replacements** and provide her with an estimated HOTO date so that she is well informed of the changes. Ensure that Crystal has **at least 3 weeks of lead time** to get accustomed to the incoming EXCO changes.
    - At this time, please inform Crystal of the full roster of EXCO roles
    - Inform her if the club requires any additional EXCO roles - she would request for justification and advise accordingly.
      - These may include a current EXCO member transitioning into the "Club Advisor" role
13. During the OJT phase, the existing Secretary will prepare the HOTO form (to be requested from Crystal at OSL) with the names of the existing and prospective EXCO teams.
14. If possible, a test should be arranged at the end of the OJT phase (running of a workshop) for the prospective EXCO team - this would allow the EXCO to determine if there are certain aspects that the prospective EXCO require more guidance on.
15. If any of the prospective EXCO members are deemed to be unsuited for the role, their names are to be removed from the HOTO form and they shall be dropped from the team telegram chat. If a suitable candidate is not found by the end of the OJT period, the EXCO can HOTO as is without the last member - this member can be sourced and HOTO-ed at a later date.

### HOTO Phase

16. If all goes well, the existing EXCO and the new EXCO will sign the HOTO form prepared by the Secretary. The form will then be submitted to Crystal (who should have been notified of the ETA for HOTO well in advance.)
17. Once the HOTO form is acknowledged by Crystal via email, the existing EXCO will officially step down and the new EXCO will take their place.

### Post HOTO

18. It is advisable for the existing EXCO to lend assistance to the new EXCO team for another **1-3 months** after the HOTO process to ensure that club operations go smoothly.
19. If any EXCO positions were unfilled, suitable replacements can be sourced afterwards (when the new EXCO is stable) and separate HOTO processes can be completed individually.
